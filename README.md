# Dashboarding-in--python

This repo consists of a mini project on an airline logs dataset. In this project I emphasize on my dashboarding skills particullarly on plotly and a snippet of the web interface Dash. Check out a brief summary of the dataset on https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-airline/1.0.1/data-preview/index.html.
